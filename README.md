Cornucopia is a smart fridge inventory system powered by modular hardware and vision-language AI. It automatically tracks fridge contents and updates a central inventory database. The system also features a virtual assistant that leverages this context to recommend recipes, suggest grocery purchases, and offer nutritional insights.
