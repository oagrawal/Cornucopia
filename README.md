Cornucopia is an intelligent system that automatically tracks your fridge inventory using computer vision and AI, helping you manage groceries, reduce food waste, and discover recipes based on what you already have. Our project won 1st place and Best Use of Generative AI at the IEEE UT Austin Techathon.

## Project Overview

Cornucopia uses a network of modular devices and Vision-Language models to convert food images into structured inventory data. The system features a Sous-Chef virtual assistant that recommends recipes, provides nutritional guidance, and suggests grocery purchases based on your current inventory.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Food Recognition
- Accurately identifies food items through image processing
- Automatically updates inventory database when items are added or removed
- Categorizes products by type, expiration date, and nutritional properties

### Smart Inventory Management
- Maintains a comprehensive food database schema:
  - Name, Category, Quantity
  - Expiry Date, Brand
- Tracks usage patterns and monitors expiration dates

### Virtual Sous-Chef Assistant
- Recommends personalized recipes based on available ingredients
- Provides nutritional advice tailored to dietary preferences
- Suggests timely grocery purchases to complement your inventory
- Supports various dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)

## Technology Stack

- **Vision AI**: Advanced image recognition for food identification
- **Generative AI**: Gemini models for intelligent recipe suggestions
- **Hardware**: Network of modular sensing devices
- **Database**: Structured schema for efficient inventory tracking
