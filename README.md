Cornucopia automatically tracks fridge inventory using a network of modular devices and Vision-Language models that convert food images into database updates. Our system also includes a Sous-Chef virtual assistant that uses built-in context about fridge inventory to recommend recipes, provide nutritional advice, and suggest grocery purchases.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Food Recognition
- Accurately identifies food items through image processing
- Automatically updates inventory database when items are added or removed
- Categorizes products by type, expiration date, and nutritional properties

### Smart Inventory Management
- Maintains a comprehensive food database schema:
  - Name, Category, Quantity
  - Expiry Date, Brand
- Tracks usage patterns and monitors expiration dates

### Virtual Sous-Chef Assistant
- Recommends personalized recipes based on available ingredients
- Provides nutritional advice tailored to dietary preferences
- Suggests timely grocery purchases to complement your inventory
- Supports various dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)
